# VirusMode

VirusMode is a useless project, crafted to be everything you never wanted, found in one place


**As this was developed for a hackathon, it is not fully completed as of yet, so some features may have bugs, need improvements, or are just not there.

If you want to test it out: 
1. Download the files and unzip
2. Open up a browser (works for google chrome and edge -> still needs testing for others)
3. Navigate to Manage Extensions and turn on Developer mode
4. Press Load Unpacked and select the VirusMode folder (make sure its the one with manifest.json directly inside)
5. Make sure the extension is on, open up a random website, and have fun!
